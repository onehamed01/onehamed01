# Hi, I'm Hamed

I have approximately 5 years of experience working as a freelance programmer. I started my journey with small scripting projects using Python, and eventually, I transitioned into Backend development. I have developed a strong interest in this field and am eager to delve deeper into it.

Currently, I am residing in the UK, and I see my skills as starting from scratch in this new environment. It feels like I am beginning my programming journey all over again.

Given the extra time I have, I am committed to a self-taught journey, starting from the basics and aiming to master Backend development. My goal is to work as a Backend Engineer in the future.

I will be pushing projects that contribute to my learning path into my repositories, complete with thorough documentation.

## Learning Path:
1. Python OOP & Advanced Level
2. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
3. Backend Fundamentals
4. Django, Flask
5. API & GraphQl
6. DevOps Concepts
